## App
BizzBuzz uses the Square, Twilio, and Twitter APIs to make it easy for small businesses to post to Twitter and manage inventory. They text a Twilio number to find out how much inventory is left, and they can also tweet via texting. This simplifies social media and checking inventory so you can focus on all that you must do for your small business (handy for people like my and Mónica's dads who don't fully understand social media, but they do text!) There's also a webapp that displays trending topics on Facebook and Twitter to help you if you want to post about those.

## Tech
We never had done Ruby on Rails, but learned it on our first day at Code Camp! That was probably the biggest challenge--getting Square, Twilio, and Twitter to all work individually, and then especially getting them all to work together after combining our work! Also, using both Macs and Windows...

### Thank you so much to Square for hosting us in Atlanta for the week! We had a blast and learned a lot.
